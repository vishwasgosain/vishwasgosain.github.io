## Projects

### Proposed a Low Power Differential Adiabatic logic Family (A-DCVSL)
Designed and implemented A-DCVSL (Adiabatic Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic), a novel low-power differential adiabatic logic at 65nm tech. node using charge recovery and split-level sinusoidal power supplies. The lower power consumption & Power Delay Product of the proposed circuit was verified by PPA(Power, Performance, Area) comparison with presently employed differential adiabatic logics.

### Designed a selection unit and an ALU for adiabatic logic families
Designed and simulated an ALU including a low power selection unit (using transmission gates) designed exclusively for adiabatic logic families. A 64.3% and 57.5% maximum reduction in power dissipation and PDP respectively were achieved compared to traditional selection unit implementation at 180nm tech. node.

### Semiconductor fabrication lab, Indian Space & Research Organisation (ISRO)
Worked in photolithography section, reduced the line width and achieved critical dimension as low as 110nm with a tool of 180nm resolution in KrF lithography while retaining original L/S width. This was accomplished using Phase Shift Masks and double exposure resolution enhancement technique.

### Look Ahead Carry Adder using Diode Free Adiabatic Logic
Implemented a look ahead adder using low power DFAL family. Performance of the circuit was compared with CMOS technology at 180nm tech. node across varying frequency and load capacitance. Maximum Power reduction of 45.7% and maximum Power Delay Product reduction of 31.4% was achieved using the proposed implementation.

### On-board precise setup-hold time measurement using FPGA 
In this project, a versatile solution for testing setup and hold time of critical paths in digital designs was proposed using FPGA. Using buffers, the proposed setup provides flexibility to maneuver the step size of the test signal’s delay using coarse and fine delay for evaluating the setup and hold time, which is lucrative in testing devices with higher variations in timing parameters accurately.

### Smart dustbin with waste segregation
The Smart dustbin was a Raspberry-Pi based system to classify waste objects and reward the user with credits based on what is dropped in the bin by making use of image processing algorithms. My contribution involved developing the detection algorithms, human machine interface and firmware for the embedded systems.
