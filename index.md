## Projects

### Proposed a Low Power Differential Adiabatic logic Family (A-DCVSL)
Designed and implemented A-DCVSL (Adiabatic Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic), a novel low-power differential adiabatic logic at 65nm tech. node using charge recovery and split-level sinusoidal power supplies. The lower power consumption & Power Delay Product of the proposed circuit was verified by PPA(Power, Performance, Area) comparison with presently employed differential adiabatic logics..
